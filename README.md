# Image-Classification-on-CIFAR-100
Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-100 dataset using PyTorch. Transformed the data using concepts like Data Normalisation and Data Augmentation. Defined a TinyVGG CNN model, 'Cifar100Model', which includes multiple convolutional layers followed by ReLU activations and MaxPooling layers.
